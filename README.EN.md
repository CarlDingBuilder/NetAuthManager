# NetAuthManager

[中文说明](README.md)

NetAuthManager is a lightweight and flexible .NET-based authorization management system, with a frontend powered by Vue.js. It supports user management, role management, menu management, menu permission management, resource-based authorization, and field-level permission control. The project is designed with a frontend-backend separation architecture, utilizing JWT for login authentication, making it easy to understand, extend, and integrate into other systems.

## Key Features:
- **User Management**: Supports adding, editing, deleting, and managing system users.
- **Role Management**: Create and configure user roles with specific permissions.
- **Menu Management**: Dynamically control system menus, showing or hiding them based on permissions.
- **Authorization Control**: Supports menu permissions, operational permissions, and fine-grained data permission management.
- **RBAC Permission Architecture**: Implements role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Frontend-Backend Separation**: Frontend built with Vue 3.0; backend built with .NET 8.
This project is ideal for building admin management systems, enterprise-level management tools, or complex authorization management services. Feel free to fork, contribute, or use it as a base for your own projects!
